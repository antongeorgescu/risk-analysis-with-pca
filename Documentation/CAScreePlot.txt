Eigenvalues correspond to the amount of information retained by each axis. 
Dimensions are ordered decreasingly and listed according to the amount of variance explained in the solution. 
Dimension 1 explains the most variance in the solution, followed by dimension 2 and so on. 
The cumulative percentage explained is obtained by adding the successive proportions of variation explained to obtain the running total. 
For instance, 48.69% plus 39.91% equals 88.6%, and so forth. Therefore, about 88.6% of the variation is explained by the first two dimensions. 
Eigenvalues can be used to determine the number of axes to retain. There is no “rule of thumb” to choose the number of dimensions to keep for the data interpretation. 
It depends on the research question and the researcher's need. For example, if you are satisfied with 80% of the total variances explained then use the number of dimensions necessary to achieve that.

Note: The point at which the scree plot shows a bend (so called "elbow") can be considered as indicating an optimal dimensionality.
