Assume the data contains M rows and N columns. 
If the data were random, the expected value of the eigenvalue for each axis would be 1/(M-1) in terms of the M rows. 
Likewise, the average axis should account for 1/(N-1) in terms of the N columns.

According to (M. T. Bendixen 1995): 
Any axis with a contribution larger than the maximum of these two percentages should be considered as important and included in the solution for the interpretation of the data.

According to the graph, only the dimensions above the average dotted red line should be used in the solution. 
The dimensions under that line explain a total inertia which is below the average eigeinvalue, too little to be kept for further analysis. 
Note that you can use some of those dimensions too. However, the supplementary dimensions are unlikely to contribute significantly 
to the interpretation of nature of the association between the rows and columns. 

The higher the retention of the dimensions above the average line, the more subtlety in the original data is retained in the low-dimensional solution (M. Bendixen 2003).
