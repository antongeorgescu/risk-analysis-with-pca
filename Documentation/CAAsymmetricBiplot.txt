To make an asymetric biplot, rows (or columns) points are plotted from the standard co-ordinates (S) 
and the profiles of the columns (or the rows) are plotted from the principale coordinates (P) (M. Bendixen 2003). 
For a given axis, the standard and principle co-ordinates are related as follows: 
	P = sqrt( eigenvalue) * S 
	P: the principal coordinate of a row (or a column) on the axis 
	eigenvalue: the eigenvalue of the axis 

Depending on the situation, other types of display can be set using the argument map (Nenadic and Greenacre 2007)
If the angle between two arrows is acute, then their is a strong association between the corresponding row and column. 
To interpret the distance between rows and and a column you should perpendicularly project row points on the column arrow.
