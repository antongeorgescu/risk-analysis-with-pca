Symetric plot represents the row and column profiles simultaneously in a common space. 
In this case, only the distance between row points or the distance between column points can be really interpreted. 
The distance between any row and column items is not meaningful! 
You can only make a general statements about the observed pattern.

In order to interpret the distance between column and row points,the column profiles must be presented in row space or vice-versa. 
This type of map is called asymmetric biplot and is going to be generated in another step.

In our graph, rows are represented by blue points and columns by red triangles. 
The distance between any row points or column points gives a measure of their similarity (or dissimilarity). 
Row points with similar profile are closed on the factor map. The same holds true for column points.
