The contribution of rows (in %) to the definition of the dimensions can be extracted and displayed.
The row variables with the larger value, contribute the most to the definition of the dimensions. 
Rows that contribute the most to Dim. 1 and Dim. 2 are the most important in explaining the variability in the data set. 
Rows that do not contribute much to any dimension or that contribute to the last dimensions are less important.
